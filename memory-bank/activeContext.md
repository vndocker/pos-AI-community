# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

### New PRD Development
- Created PRD for AI-Enhanced POS System (design/PRDs/1.AI-enhanced-POS-system.md)
- Focused on AI features for small retail store owners
- Planned gradual rollout with Rapid MVP approach (3-4 months)
- Prioritized Product Recognition, Smart Inventory Management, and Customer Experience features
- Designed with AI Assistant interface and microservices architecture
- Comprehensive analytics approach for data collection


### Active Components
1. **Point of Sale (POS)**
   - Main transaction interface
   - Product scanning via CameraModal
   - Cart management
   - Payment processing

2. **Product Management**
   - Product listing and editing
   - Bulk import functionality via ImportProductsModal
   - Inventory tracking

3. **Invoice System**
   - Transaction history
   - Invoice generation
   - Receipt templates

### Recent Changes
Based on the file structure and open tabs:
- Implementation of camera-based product scanning
- Development of product import functionality
- Testing coverage for POS and ImportProducts components
- Backend API endpoints for inventory and invoice management

### Current Priorities
1. **Frontend**
   - POS functionality refinement
   - Product management improvements
   - Testing coverage expansion

2. **Backend**
   - Temporal.io workflow implementation
   - API endpoint optimization
   - Database operations
   - Invoice template system

3. **Integration**
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Frontend-backend communication
   - Offline capability implementation
   - Data synchronization

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Frontend**
   - Component-based structure for maintainability
   - Material-UI for consistent design
   - React Router for navigation
   - Local state management for simplicity

2. **Backend**
   - FastAPI for high-performance API
   - Temporal.io for workflow orchestration
   - SQLite for local data storage
   - JWT for authentication
   - Modular router organization

3. **Workflow Architecture**
   - Clearly defined workflow boundaries
   - Activity-based task decomposition
   - Strong typing with Python type hints
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Retry policies for resilience

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance**
   - Optimize component rendering
   - Efficient database queries
   - Resource caching strategy
   - Workflow execution optimization

2. **User Experience**
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Fast transaction processing
   - Reliable workflow status tracking

3. **Data Management**
   - Offline data persistence
   - Sync conflict resolution
   - Data validation and integrity
   - Workflow state persistence

4. **Workflow Management**
   - Activity timeout configuration
   - Error handling strategies
   - State management
   - Retry policies

## Next Steps
