<Product Summary>
This document details the requirements for a POS (Point-of-Sale) application tailored to the retail industry. The application integrates AI assistance to provide product information, sales insights, and personalized recommendations. The system supports store employees (for daily selling tasks) and store owners (for inventory management, data analytics, and strategy planning). The two-panel interface allows users to either directly manage orders or interact with the AI Assistant for suggestions and insights.

Title: View and Select Products
Description: As store staff, I want to view a list of products so that I can easily select and add them to the order.
Acceptance Criteria:
The application displays available products on the main POS panel.
Users can search for products by name, category, or barcode.
Selected products are added to the current order.

==========
To successfully implement the "View and Select Products" use case for the POS application, we'll break down the process into several components, including UI/UX design, frontend flow, backend workflow, database schema, and integration with the Temporal workflow for processing in Python. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:

### 1. UI/UX Design

#### Main POS Panel Interface
- **Header Section**
  - Search bar with filters (by name, category, and barcode).
  - Filters as dropdowns or multi-select chips.

- **Product List Section**
  - A grid or list view displaying product cards.
  - Each product card displays:
    - Product image
    - Product name
    - Category
    - Price
  - Add to Order button or quantity selector for each product.

- **Current Order Section**
  - Area where selected products are listed.
  - Displays product name, quantity, individual price, and total price.
  - Option to adjust quantities or remove products.

#### User Interaction Flow
- User enters search criteria or selects a filter to narrow down products.
- Products are displayed based on the filter or search results.
- User selects products by clicking “Add to Order” or adjusting quantity.
- Products and updates are reflected in the Current Order Section.

### 2. Frontend Flowchart (React + Next.js)

1. **User Input**
   - Search bar input or filter selection from the user.

2. **Fetch Products**
   - Dispatch fetchProducts action to request data from the backend using search/filter params.

3. **Display Products**
   - On fetch success, display product cards in the UI.

4. **Select Products**
   - User clicks “Add to Order” on product card.
   - Dispatch addProductToOrder action to update the Redux state or context.

5. **Update Order View**
   - Render the Current Order Section with selected products.
   - Allow quantity adjustments or removal.

### 3. Database Design Model (MySQL)

#### Product Table
- `product_id` (Primary Key, Integer)
- `name` (Varchar)
- `category` (Varchar)
- `barcode` (Varchar)
- `price` (Decimal)
- `stock_quantity` (Integer)
- `image_url` (Varchar)

#### Order Table
- `order_id` (Primary Key, Integer)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key, references Users)

#### Order_Product Table
- `order_id` (Foreign Key, references Orders)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key, references Products)
- `quantity` (Integer)
- `total_price` (Decimal)

### 4. Backend Step-by-Step Workflow (Python + Temporal)

#### 4.1 Temporal Workflow Initialization
- Define a Temporal workflow to handle fetching, processing, and updating orders.

#### 4.2 Fetch Products
1. **API Endpoint `/products`**
   - Receive GET request with optional query parameters: `name`, `category`, `barcode`.
   - Invoke Temporal workflow to query the database.

2. **Database Query**
   - Use the query parameters to construct a SQL `SELECT` statement.
   - Fetch results from the `Products` table and return as JSON response.

#### 4.3 Add Product to Order
1. **API Endpoint `/order/add`**
   - Receive POST request with `order_id`, `product_id`, and `quantity`.
   - Invoke a Temporal workflow to handle the addition.

2. **Modify Order**
   - Check if the product is already in the order.
   - If exists, update the quantity; else, insert a new entry in `Order_Product`.
   - Update the total price in real-time.

3. **Respond to Frontend**
   - Return updated order details and confirmation to the frontend.

### 5. Integration Plan

- **React Component to Backend**
  - Use Axios or Fetch API to communicate between React components and backend services.
  
- **Temporal Deployment**
  - Deployed on a Temporal server with worker hosts consuming tasks related to product operations and order management.

- **Testing and Iterations**
  - Conduct testing for UI/UX, API endpoints, database queries, and larger workflow integration.
  - Iterate on design based on user feedback and performance analysis.

This overall design provides a comprehensive approach to building the "View and Select Products" use case for a modern POS application in the retail industry. It emphasizes user experience, seamless interactions, and robust backend processing.
