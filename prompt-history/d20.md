Based on all your responses, I've drafted a PRD for the AI-enhanced POS system. Here it is:

Product Requirements Document: AI-Enhanced POS System
Overview
The AI-Enhanced POS System will integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into our existing point-of-sale application to provide small retail store owners with intelligent tools that improve their business operations. The system will use a hybrid approach to AI, with an assistant-style interface that makes advanced features accessible to non-technical users.

What We Are Building
We are enhancing our existing POS system with AI capabilities focused on:

Product Recognition (AI-powered camera scanning)
Smart Inventory Management (predictions, restock recommendations, demand forecasting)
Customer Experience (personalized recommendations)
Smart Advertisement Display
AI-powered reporting and analytics
Operations Optimization (pricing optimization, fraud detection)
Why Build It?
Small retail store owners face numerous challenges:

Limited time for inventory management
Difficulty predicting customer demand
Challenges with optimal pricing
Limited technical expertise
Need for business insights without data analysis skills
Our AI-enhanced POS system addresses these pain points by automating routine tasks, providing actionable insights, and offering intelligent recommendations that improve business performance without requiring technical expertise.
