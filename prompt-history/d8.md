Topic: Add new function (US)- Scan barcode / search product POS main screen
Prompt
Hãy viết User story chuẩn, ngôn ngữ tiếng anh cho yêu cầu sau:

Tại màn hình POS, người dùng muốn nhập sử dụng camera điện thoại hoặc máy quét barcode để nhập liệu nhanh vào ô "Tìm kiếm sản phẩm"

Yêu cầu:

Vào màn hình, ô "Tìm kiếm sản phẩm" lập tức được focus

Có thể Focus lại ô này bằng cách nhấn phím F1

Bên cạnh input có nút camera, khi user click vào sẽ hỏi quyền chụp ảnh

Khi user chụp ảnh, sử dụng thư viện barcode from image (client js) để phân tích ảnh sang mã barcode và fill vào ô "Tìm kiếm sản phẩm"

Sau khi có thông tin tại ô "Tìm kiếm sản phẩm", hệ thống tự động tìm kiếm

Nếu tìm thấy chỉ 1 sản phẩm, thực hiện chọn sản phẩm vào "Giỏ hàng" với số lượng mặc định bằng 1 nếu giỏ hàng chưa có sản phẩm này, nếu giỏ hàng đã có thì tăng số lượng lên 1 sản phẩm mỗi lần quét / nhập

User Story

As a POS system user (cashier, etc.)
I want to be able to quickly add products to a sale by scanning a barcode using my phone's camera or a dedicated barcode scanner
So that I can process transactions faster and with fewer errors.
Acceptance Criteria

When the POS screen loads, the "Product Search" field is automatically focused.
The "Product Search" field can be refocused by pressing the F1 key.
A camera button is displayed next to the "Product Search" field.
When the user clicks the camera button, the system requests permission to access the device's camera.
When the user takes a picture, the system uses a client-side JavaScript barcode library to analyze the image and extract the barcode data.
The extracted barcode data is automatically populated into the "Product Search" field.
After data is entered into the "Product Search" field (either manually or via barcode scan), the system automatically performs a product search.
If the search returns only one product, that product is automatically added to the "Shopping Cart".
If the product is not already in the cart, it is added with a default quantity of 1.
If the product is already in the cart, the quantity is increased by 1.
Additional Notes (Optional)

Consider adding error handling for cases where the barcode cannot be read from the image or when the product search returns no results.
You might want to specify which barcode scanning library should be used.
Consider including UI/UX details, such as how the camera view should be displayed and how feedback should be provided to the user during the scanning process.

Cline response:

Let me analyze the task and the current codebase to create a plan for implementing barcode scanning functionality in the POS system.

Key requirements:

Auto-focus Product Search field on load and F1 key press
Add camera button for barcode scanning
Implement camera access and barcode scanning
Auto-populate search field with barcode data
Auto-search and add product to cart
First, I should check if there are any additional files I need to examine to understand the full context.

I now have a good understanding of the current codebase and requirements. Let me outline a detailed implementation plan:

Dependencies needed:
@zxing/browser and @zxing/library for barcode scanning (industry standard, well-maintained)
@mui/icons-material for camera icon (already using MUI)
Component Changes:
Add useRef for search input focus management
Add useEffect for initial focus and F1 key listener
Add camera button next to search field
Create modal component for camera view
Add state management for camera modal
Add error handling states
Implementation Steps: 
a) Search Field Focus:
Add ref to TextField
Focus on mount
Add F1 key event listener
b) Camera Integration:

Create CameraModal component
Handle permissions
Implement video stream
Add barcode detection logic
Handle successful scans
Handle errors (permissions, scanning failures)
c) Search Field Integration:

Auto-populate field with scan result
Trigger search
Auto-add single product results to cart
Let me present this plan to the user.


I've analyzed the requirements and current codebase. Here's my proposed implementation plan:

We'll use the following libraries:
@zxing/browser and @zxing/library for barcode scanning
Industry standard JavaScript port of ZXing
Supports multiple barcode formats
Works client-side without server processing
Good browser compatibility
Active maintenance and community support
Component Structure:
// New Components
- CameraModal
  - Camera permission handling
  - Video stream display
  - Barcode detection overlay
  - Error messaging

// Enhanced POS Component
- Auto-focus management
- F1 key handler
- Camera button
- Scan result handling
Implementation Details: 
a) Search Field Enhancements:
Auto-focus on load
F1 key listener for refocus
Camera button with icon
Direct barcode input support
b) Camera Integration:

Permission request handling
Live video stream
Real-time barcode detection
Success/error feedback
Automatic search triggering
c) Error Handling:

Camera permission denied
Device without camera
Unreadable barcodes
Product not found
Multiple products found
