Prompt:

Generate unit tests for Profile Settings screen function, include upload s3 and presign url api. Validate both success and failure, and include edge cases.
After gen unit tests, run test case and fix it to success case

Cline:

I'll create a test suite for the ProfileModal component that covers both the frontend component and its integration with the backend APIs. Here's the detailed test plan:

Component Rendering Tests:

Test initial render with default props
Verify all form elements are present
Check avatar display with and without user avatar_url
Validate disabled state of save button based on conditions
Username Update Tests:

Test username field updates
Validate username-only update flow
Test error handling for username update failures
File Upload Tests:

Test file selection validation:
Valid image file under 500KB
File size exceeding 500KB limit
Invalid file type
Test file selection UI updates
Mock successful file selection flow
Avatar Upload Integration Tests:

Test presigned URL request flow:
Success case
API error handling
Test R2 upload flow:
Mock successful upload
Network error handling
Invalid response handling
Test upload confirmation flow:
Success case with new avatar URL
Error during confirmation
Old avatar cleanup verification
Combined Update Tests:

Test updating both username and avatar
Test partial updates (only username or only avatar)
Verify proper error handling and rollback
Test loading states during updates
Edge Cases:

Test network timeout scenarios
Test concurrent update handling
Test with various file types and sizes
Test with invalid presigned URLs
Test with expired presigned URLs
Error Handling Tests:

API errors at different stages
Network failures
Invalid server responses
Rate limiting scenarios
Permission errors
Test Implementation Approach:

Use Jest and React Testing Library
Mock axios for API calls
Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
Create test utilities for file upload mocking
Implement custom hooks for auth context testing



====
I have a complete plan for implementing and testing the Profile Settings functionality. To proceed with implementation, we'll need to:

Create the test file ProfileModal.test.jsx with all the test cases outlined in my previous plan
Set up test utilities and mocks for:
Auth context
File upload handling
API responses
R2 storage interactions
Run the tests and fix any failing cases
Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
