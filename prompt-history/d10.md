Prompt: initialize memory bank

I see projectbrief.md exists but is quite minimal. I'll need to:

Create the remaining core files:
productContext.md
activeContext.md
systemPatterns.md
techContext.md
progress.md
Analyze the codebase to populate these files with accurate information:
Frontend is a React app with components for POS, Products, Invoices
Backend is a Python FastAPI app with routers for health, inventory, invoices, products
Database appears to be SQLite (pos.db)
Let me start by creating productContext.md to document the product goals and user experience.

Now let me create techContext.md to document the technical stack and development setup. I'll analyze the package.json and requirements.txt files to get accurate dependency information.

Now I'll create activeContext.md to document the current state and focus of development. I'll analyze the codebase structure and recent files to understand the current priorities.

Finally, I'll create progress.md to track what's been implemented and what remains to be built. I'll analyze the codebase structure and components to document the current state of completion.

I have now initialized all the core Memory Bank files:

projectbrief.md (existed)
productContext.md (created)
systemPatterns.md (created)
techContext.md (created)
activeContext.md (created)
progress.md (created)

I have now completed initializing the Memory Bank by:

Creating all required core files:
productContext.md
systemPatterns.md
techContext.md
activeContext.md
progress.md
Creating .clinerules to capture project patterns and preferences
Each file has been populated with accurate information based on analysis of:

Project structure and files
Frontend dependencies (package.json)
Backend dependencies (requirements.txt)
Code organization and patterns
Let me present the completion of this task.

====

Memory Bank has been initialized with all required documentation:
projectbrief.md (existing) - Core project requirements and goals
productContext.md - Product purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals
systemPatterns.md - System architecture, design patterns, and component relationships
techContext.md - Technology stack, development setup, and technical constraints
activeContext.md - Current development focus, recent changes, and next steps
progress.md - Feature implementation status, work in progress, and known issues
Additionally, created .clinerules to capture project-specific patterns, preferences, and evolution.
All files are structured to provide comprehensive project context and will serve as the foundation for maintaining accurate documentation throughout development.
