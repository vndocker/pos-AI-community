Follow these steps to create your PRD

Begin with a brief introduction stating the purpose of the document.

Organize your PRD into the following sections:

<prd_outline>
## Title  
### 1. Title and Overview  
#### 1.1 Document Title & Version  
#### 1.2 Product Summary  
### 2. User Personas  
#### 2.1 Key User Types  
#### 2.2 Basic Persona Details  
#### 2.3 Role-based Access  
- Briefly describe each user role (e.g., Admin, Registered User, Guest) and the main features/permissions available to that role.  
### 3. User Stories  
</prd_outline>

For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the PRD instructions. Ensure that you:
Use clean and concise language
Provide specific details and metrics where required
Maintain consistency throughout the document
Address all points mentioned in each section
When creating user stories and acceptance criteria:
List ALL necessary user stories including primary, alternative, and edge-case scenarios.
Assign a unique requirement ID (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability
Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrictions
Ensure no potential user interaction is omitted
Make sure each user story is testable
<user_story>
- ID  
- Title  
- Description  
- Acceptance Criteria  
</user_story>

After completing the PRD, review it against this Final Checklist:
Is every user story testable?
Are acceptance criteria clear and specific?
Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application for it?
Have we addressed authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?
Format your PRD:
Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
Don’t format text in markdown bold "**", we don’t need this.
List ALL User Stories in the output!
Format the PRD in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers.
