Implement service worker for offline functionality
Add local storage for product data and transactions
Create background sync for pending transactions
Add "Add to Home Screen" functionality with proper manifest.json setup
UI/UX Improvements
Enhance visual feedback for touch interactions
Optimize payment flow for mobile screens
Improve cart management on small screens
2. Payment Evidence Implementation (Priority 2)
Bank Transfer Confirmation
Create a payment confirmation screen showing bank transfer status
Implement a way to capture/upload bank transfer receipts
Add transaction reference number tracking
Integration with POS Flow
Seamlessly integrate payment evidence capture into checkout process
Store payment evidence with transaction records
Allow viewing payment evidence in transaction history
3. E-Invoice Enhancement (Priority 3)
QR Code Implementation
Generate unique QR codes for each invoice
Link QR codes to publicly accessible invoice URLs
Ensure QR codes are easily scannable on various devices
Receipt Viewing Experience
Create mobile-optimized receipt viewing page
Ensure receipts are accessible offline once loaded
Add options to download or share receipts
Implementation Approach
For each feature, I'll follow this workflow:

Test-Driven Development

Write tests for each component and feature
Define expected behavior for both online and offline scenarios
PWA Implementation

Configure service worker for offline capabilities
Set up proper caching strategies
Implement background sync for offline transactions
Mobile-First Development

Start with mobile layouts and progressively enhance for larger screens
Test on various screen sizes and orientations
Optimize touch targets and interactions
Documentation & Memory Updates

Update the memory file with implementation details
Document offline capabilities and limitations
Update todo list as features are completed
Technical Implementation Details
Service Worker Strategy
Cache-first strategy for static assets
Network-first with cache fallback for API requests
Background sync for offline transactions
Local Storage Approach
IndexedDB for product catalog and transaction history
LocalStorage for user preferences and session data
Sync conflicts resolution strategy
QR Code Generation
Generate QR codes on the server side
Link to publicly accessible URLs for invoice viewing
Include transaction ID and verification token in QR data
Would you like me to proceed with implementing these features in the priority order you specified? I'll start with the POS main screen enhancements focusing on mobile-first design and offline capabilities.

POS Main Screen Enhancement Plan
I'll focus on enhancing the POS main screen with mobile-first responsive design and offline capabilities. Here's my detailed implementation plan:

1. Mobile-First Responsive Design
Current Issues to Address
The product grid layout may not be optimized for small screens
Cart management can be difficult on mobile devices
Payment section might be too cramped on small screens
Implementation Steps
1.1 Responsive Layout Structure
Modify the Grid container to use different column layouts based on screen size
For mobile: Stack the product search and cart sections vertically
For tablets: Use a 60/40 or 50/50 split between products and cart
For desktop: Keep the current layout with potential refinements
1.2 Product Grid Optimization
Reduce the number of products shown per row on smaller screens
Increase touch target sizes for mobile users
Implement swipe gestures for product navigation on mobile
Add a compact view option for dense product listings
1.3 Cart Management Improvements
Create a collapsible/expandable cart view for mobile
Implement swipe-to-remove functionality for cart items
Add quick quantity adjustment buttons optimized for touch
Ensure the payment section is always visible or easily accessible
1.4 Search and Scanning Enhancements
Make the search bar sticky on scroll for mobile
Optimize the camera scanning modal for mobile devices
Add voice search capability as an alternative input method
2. Offline Capabilities
Implementation Steps
2.1 Service Worker Setup
Create a service worker configuration for the POS application
Implement caching strategies for static assets and API responses
Set up proper lifecycle management for the service worker
2.2 Local Data Storage
Use IndexedDB to store product catalog locally
Implement a mechanism to sync product data when online
Create a versioning system for the local database to handle updates
2.3 Offline Transaction Processing
Allow creating transactions while offline
Store pending transactions in IndexedDB
Implement background sync to process transactions when back online
Add visual indicators for offline mode and pending transactions
2.4 PWA Configuration
Update the manifest.json file for proper "Add to Home Screen" functionality
Configure appropriate icons and splash screens for various devices
Set up proper caching headers and strategies
Implement app installation prompts at appropriate times
Testing Strategy
Responsive Design Testing
Create tests for different viewport sizes
Test touch interactions on various screen sizes
Verify layout changes at different breakpoints
Offline Functionality Testing
Test application behavior when network is disconnected
Verify data persistence across page refreshes while offline
Test synchronization when connection is restored
Verify proper handling of conflicts during sync
Implementation Approach
I'll implement these features using a test-driven approach:

Write tests for responsive behavior and offline functionality
Implement the responsive layout changes
Set up the service worker and offline data storage
Implement offline transaction processing
Add visual indicators and user feedback for offline mode
Test thoroughly across different devices and network conditions
Update the memory file with implementation details
Update the todo list to reflect completed tasks
