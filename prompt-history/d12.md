# Update memory bank with following rules

## Backend:

## Role and Expertise
You are an expert Python developer with extensive experience in Temporal.io for workflow orchestration. Your code is clean, efficient, and adheres to best practices in workflow and activity implementation.

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Write concise, readable Python code.
- Follow PEP 8 and PEP 257 for style and documentation.
- Use Python type hints in all functions and methods.
- Document all workflows and activities using descriptive docstrings.

### Temporal.io Best Practices
- Use `@workflow.defn` and `@activity.defn` decorators on all workflows and activities.
- Name workflows with a `_workflow` suffix (e.g., `process_order_workflow`).
- Name activities with an `_activity` suffix (e.g., `send_email_activity`).

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables and Functions**: snake_case
- **Classes**: PascalCase
- **Files**: snake_case
- **Workflows and Activities**:
  - Workflows: snake_case ending with `_workflow`.
  - Activities: snake_case ending with `_activity`.

### Error Handling
- Always wrap activities with proper try-except blocks.
- Log errors with context using Python's `logging` module.
- Use Temporal's built-in error handling for retries and timeouts.

## Project Structure
Organize the project with clear separation of concerns:
- **workflows/**: Define all Temporal workflows here.
- **activities/**: Implement all activity definitions.
- **tests/**: Place unit tests and integration tests in this directory.
- **utils/**: Include reusable utilities and helpers.

## Dependencies
- Ensure `temporalio` is listed in dependencies.
- Avoid usage of `celery` or any conflicting task queue systems.

## Documentation Standards
- Use Python docstrings for all workflows and activities:
  ```python
  @workflow.defn
  class ProcessOrderWorkflow:
      """Workflow for processing an order."""
  ```

## Testing Standards
- Write tests for all workflows and activities using `pytest`.
- Mock Temporal APIs where needed for isolated testing.
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage.

## CI/CD Integration
- Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
- Include the following checks:
  - Linting with `flake8`.
  - Type checking with `mypy`.
  - Unit testing with `pytest`.

## Code Examples

### Workflow Example
```python
from temporalio import workflow

@workflow.defn
class ProcessOrderWorkflow:
    """Workflow to process customer orders."""

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, order_id: str):
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            "send_email_activity", order_id, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
        )
```

### Activity Example
```python
from temporalio import activity

@activity.defn
async def send_email_activity(order_id: str):
    """Send a confirmation email for an order."""
    try:
        # Simulate sending email
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        activity.logger.error(f"Failed to send email for order {order_id}: {str(e)}")
        raise



=============================

I need to review the current memory bank files to understand the project context and then update them with the new backend rules. Let me start by reading all the memory bank files.


I've now reviewed all the memory bank files and understand the current state of the project. The task is to update the memory bank with new backend rules focusing on Temporal.io integration. This will primarily affect systemPatterns.md and techContext.md, with some updates needed in activeContext.md and progress.md to reflect the new workflow system implementation.

Let me present a plan for updating the memory bank files.


I've reviewed all memory bank files and have a plan for incorporating the new backend rules. Here's how I propose to update each relevant file:

> systemPatterns.md
Add new section for Temporal.io workflow patterns
Update backend architecture diagram to include workflow components
Add workflow and activity patterns section
Include code organization standards for workflows/activities
> techContext.md
Add Temporal.io to core backend technologies
Update development setup with Temporal worker configuration
Add new section for workflow-specific technical constraints
Update dependencies to include temporalio
> activeContext.md
Add current workflow implementation status
Update technical considerations for workflow orchestration
Add workflow-related next steps
Update architecture decisions to reflect Temporal adoption
> progress.md
Add new section for workflow implementation progress
Update backend tasks to include workflow development
Add known issues section for workflow-related challenges
Update next release goals to include workflow orchestration

Prompt: Refactor sign-in workflow, backend only

Cline:

I've reviewed the current auth.py implementation and can now propose a plan to refactor the sign-in workflow following the new backend rules for Temporal.io. Let me outline the changes needed.


I'll propose a refactoring plan for the sign-in workflow that aligns with our new Temporal.io backend rules:

Workflow and Activity Separation

Move workflows to /workflows/auth_workflow.py
Move activities to /activities/auth_activities.py
Follow new naming conventions (_workflow and _activity suffixes)
Workflow Improvements

@workflow.defn
class ProcessSignInWorkflow:
    """Workflow for handling the sign-in process."""
    
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, email: str) -> dict:
        # Enhanced error handling and logging
        # Proper activity timeouts
        # Retry policies
Activity Refinements

@activity.defn
async def validate_email_activity(email: str) -> bool:
    """Activity for validating email format and existence."""

@activity.defn
async def generate_otp_activity() -> str:
    """Activity for generating secure OTP."""

@activity.defn
async def send_email_activity(email: str, otp: str) -> bool:
    """Activity for sending OTP email."""
Error Handling Improvements

Add proper activity retry policies
Implement comprehensive error logging
Add timeout configurations
Handle edge cases explicitly
Code Organization

├── workflows/
│   └── auth_workflow.py
├── activities/
│   └── auth_activities.py
├── routers/
│   └── auth.py (simplified)
Type Safety

Add comprehensive type hints
Use Pydantic models for data validation
Implement proper return type definitions
Would you like me to proceed with implementing these changes? I'll need you to toggle to Act mode so I can create the necessary files and implement the refactored workflow.



I'll start by creating the new directory structure and moving the workflow and activity code to their respective files. First, I'll create the workflows and activities directories.


Cline wants to execute this command:
mkdir backend/app/workflows backend/app/activities




Now I'll create the auth_activities.py file with the refactored activities following the new standards.


Cline wants to create a new file:




Now I'll create the auth_workflow.py file with the refactored workflow following the new standards, including proper retry policies and error handling.


Cline wants to create a new file:




Now I'll update the auth.py router to use the new workflow and activity implementations, removing the old code and simplifying the endpoints.


Cline wants to edit this file:




I've completed the refactoring of the sign-in workflow following the new backend rules. The changes include:

Separated activities into auth_activities.py with proper error handling and logging
Created dedicated workflow definitions in auth_workflow.py with retry policies
Simplified the auth.py router to focus on endpoint handling
Added comprehensive type hints and docstrings
Implemented proper error handling throughout
Let me summarize the changes in the completion.


Task Completed
The sign-in workflow has been refactored according to the new backend rules with Temporal.io best practices:

Activities (auth_activities.py):
Separated into individual activity functions with _activity suffix
Added comprehensive error handling and logging
Improved email validation and OTP generation
Enhanced Turnstile verification
Added proper type hints and docstrings
Workflows (auth_workflow.py):
Created SignInWorkflow and VerifyOTPWorkflow classes
Implemented proper retry policies for each activity
Added configurable timeouts
Enhanced error handling and logging
Used type hints and descriptive docstrings
Router (auth.py):
Simplified endpoint handlers
Moved business logic to workflows
Improved error handling with proper HTTP exceptions
Added return type annotations
Enhanced documentation
The new structure follows the project's workflow patterns:

Clear separation of concerns between activities and workflows
Proper error handling at each level
Comprehensive logging for debugging
Type safety throughout the codebase
Consistent naming conventions
The refactored code is now more maintainable, testable, and follows Temporal.io best practices for workflow orchestration.
