- **Supporting Actors**:
  - Customer
  - Payment Gateway System
  - Receipt Printer
  - Inventory Management System

### Goal:

Enable the store staff to process various payment methods efficiently and securely so that customers can complete their purchases.

### Preconditions:

- The POS system is operational and connected to necessary peripherals (card readers, receipt printers).
- The staff member is logged into the system with appropriate permissions.
- Items to be purchased have been scanned, and the total amount due is calculated and displayed.

### Postconditions:

- The payment is processed successfully.
- A payment confirmation is displayed to the staff and optionally to the customer.
- A receipt is printed and/or provided digitally.
- The transaction is recorded in the sales system.
- Inventory levels are updated accordingly.

### Main Success Scenario:

1. **Initiate Payment**:
   - The staff member selects the "Process Payment" option on the POS interface.
   - The system displays the total amount due.

2. **Select Payment Method(s)**:
   - The staff member asks the customer for their preferred payment method(s).
   - The staff member selects the appropriate payment method(s) on the POS:
     - Cash
     - Credit Card
     - Debit Card
     - Mobile Payment (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay)

3. **Split Payment (if applicable)**:
   - If the customer wishes to use multiple payment methods:
     - The staff member selects the "Split Payment" option.
     - The system allows entry of the amount to be paid by each method.
     - The system calculates and displays the remaining balance after each method is entered.

4. **Process Cash Payment**:
   - The staff member enters the amount of cash received from the customer.
   - The system calculates the change due.
   - The system displays the change amount to the staff member.
   - The staff member provides the change to the customer.

5. **Process Card Payment**:
   - The customer inserts, swipes, or taps their card on the card reader.
   - The system sends the payment information securely to the payment gateway.
   - The system waits for authorization from the payment gateway.
   - Upon approval, the system records the transaction.
   - If declined, the system alerts the staff member to request another payment method.

6. **Process Mobile Payment**:
   - The customer taps or scans their mobile device at the terminal.
   - The system processes the payment similar to card payments.
   - Confirmation is received from the payment gateway.

7. **Payment Confirmation**:
   - Once the total amount due is paid, the system displays a confirmation message.
   - The system optionally displays a summary of the payment methods used.

8. **Print Receipt**:
   - The system prompts to print a receipt.
   - The staff member confirms.
   - The receipt is printed and handed to the customer.
   - Optionally, the receipt can be sent digitally via email or SMS.

9. **Update Records**:
   - The system updates the sales records with the transaction details.
   - Inventory levels are adjusted based on the items sold.

### Extensions (Alternate Flows):

- **E1: Insufficient Cash**:
  - If the cash received is less than the amount due:
    - The system alerts the staff member.
    - The staff member requests additional payment from the customer.

- **E2: Payment Declined**:
  - If a card or mobile payment is declined:
    - The system displays an error message.
    - The staff member informs the customer.
    - Return to step 2 to select an alternative payment method.

- **E3: System Error**:
  - If there's a system error during payment processing:
    - The system displays an error message.
    - The staff member can retry or cancel the transaction.
    - If canceled, the transaction is voided, and no records are updated.

### Special Requirements:

- **Security**:
  - All electronic payments must be processed securely and comply with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
  - Customer payment data must be protected and not stored unnecessarily.

- **Usability**:
  - The payment interface should be intuitive and require minimal steps to complete a transaction.
  - The system should provide clear instructions and feedback at each step.

- **Performance**:
  - Payment processing should be quick to minimize customer wait times.
  - The system should handle peak transaction times without degradation in performance.

### Assumptions:

- The payment gateway is operational and can process transactions without delays.
- Customers have valid payment methods.
