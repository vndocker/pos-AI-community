@/backend/app/ Generate unit tests for upload api to R2. Validate both success and failure, and include edge cases. After gen unit tests, run test case and fix failed tests

Let me analyze the task and available files:

I need to create unit tests for the R2 upload API functionality
I see the R2 storage utility is in backend/app/utils/r2_storage.py
I should first read the R2 storage implementation to understand what to test
Tests should be placed in backend/app/tests/ directory
I need to test both success and failure cases, including edge cases
Let me first read the R2 storage implementation.


Cline wants to read this file:




Now that I have the R2 storage implementation, I can see it has 3 main methods to test:

generate_presigned_url()
delete_object()
generate_avatar_key()
I need to create comprehensive tests that cover:

Success cases
Failure cases (invalid credentials, network errors)
Edge cases (invalid object keys, expired URLs)
I'll create a new test file in the tests directory. I'll use pytest and moto library to mock S3/R2 interactions.

First, let me create the test file.
