# Product Requirements Document: AI-Enhanced POS System

## Overview
The AI-Enhanced POS System will integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into our existing point-of-sale application to provide small retail store owners with intelligent tools that improve their business operations. The system will use a hybrid approach to AI, with an assistant-style interface that makes advanced features accessible to non-technical users.

## What We Are Building
We are enhancing our existing POS system with AI capabilities focused on:
1. Product Recognition (AI-powered camera scanning)
2. Smart Inventory Management (predictions, restock recommendations, demand forecasting)
3. Customer Experience (personalized recommendations)
4. Smart Advertisement Display
5. AI-powered reporting and analytics
6. Operations Optimization (pricing optimization, fraud detection)

## Why Build It?
Small retail store owners face numerous challenges:
- Limited time for inventory management
- Difficulty predicting customer demand
- Challenges with optimal pricing
- Limited technical expertise
- Need for business insights without data analysis skills

Our AI-enhanced POS system addresses these pain points by automating routine tasks, providing actionable insights, and offering intelligent recommendations that improve business performance without requiring technical expertise.
